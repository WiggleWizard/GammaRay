## Introduction
The aim of GammaRay is to be an open source crossplatform 3D game engine/application framework. The engine is primarily being developed to fit a specific game, however there's a lot of plans for the project above that.

## Current Status
Currently the engine's still in very early stages, so nothing of substance can be made yet.

## Architecture
Current architecture is heavily inspired by The Cherno's game engine series and Godot. There will be diagrams soon that cover the full breadth of the architecture.

## Building
### Cloning
`git clone git@github.com:WiggleWizard/GammaRay.git --recurse-submodules`

## Windows
Simply double click on the `generate_vs2019_proj.bat` file which will generate VS2019 project files. Once that's complete open and compile the project file. Binaries will be contained in the `bin` directory.

## Making a game/application
TBD
